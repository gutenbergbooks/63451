<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>I have always believed that the Poet of the New World&mdash;of the World&mdash;was
to come out of the West&mdash;from California.  Why not?  Would it be more
strange that this broad land by the shores of the vast Pacific should
produce the Supreme Singer, than that a little Island of the far
Atlantic should have given birth to the Bard of Avon&mdash;to that kinglier
brow than ever wore a crown?</p>

<p>For California is a Poem!  The land of romance, of mystery, of worship,
of beauty and of Song.  It chants from her snow-crested, cloud-bannered
mountain-ranges; it hymns thro' her forests of sky-reaching pine and
sequoia; it ripples in her flowered and fruited valleys; it thunders
from her fountains pouring, as it were, from the very waters above the
firmament; it anthems from the deeps of the mightiest ocean of the world;
and echoes ever in the syllables of her own strangely beautiful
name,&mdash;California.</p>

<p>The spell of enchantment which she wove about me from the day when&mdash;a
little child&mdash;I entered her borders thro' the rocky mountain-pass from
the long trail across the great plains, was not lessened by the
after-vision of the Southland grape and fig, orange and pomegranate,&mdash;or
the (so-called) deserts of sand and cacti, which the spring months
covered with a carpet of bloom rivalling the richest dyes of the Persian
looms.  Rather has it increased with the passing of time.</p>

<p>And then she is, as our brothers of France would say, of such a Bigness;
is so stupendous!  Surely, of her, greatness only should be born: why
not the greatest of all,&mdash;the Master Singer?</p>

<p>With all this mind-enwoven, it was but natural, when in after years I
was asked by the University of California to contribute a poem for its
Commencement Day, that I should seek to voice my belief.  How inadequate
the expression to the inner song only I may fully realize.  Yet am I
glad that the first Commencement Poem to be written by a woman for any
university, is of, and bears the name of California.</p>

<h2 class="title">CALIFORNIA</h2>


<p class="level1">Was it the sigh and shiver of the leaves?<br />
Was it the murmur of the meadow brook,<br />
That in and out the reeds and water weeds<br />
Slipped silverly, and on their tremulous keys<br />
Uttered her many melodies?  Or voice<br />
Of the far sea, red with the sunset gold,<br />
That sang within her shining shores, and sang<br />
Within the Gate, that in the sunset shone<br />
A gate of fire against the outer world?</p>

<p class="level1">For, ever as I turned the magic page<br />
Of that old song the old, blind singer sang<br />
Unto the world, when it and song were young&mdash;<br />
The ripple of the reeds, or odorous,<br />
Soft sigh of leaves, or voice of the far sea&mdash;<br />
A mystical, low murmur, tremulous<br />
Upon the wind, came in with musk of rose,<br />
The salt breath of the waves, and far, faint smell<br />
Of laurel up the slopes of Tamalpais. . . .</p>

<p class="level1">"Am I less fair, am I less fair than these,<br />
     <span class="level2">Daughters of far-off seas?</span><br />
Daughters of far-off shores,&mdash;bleak, over-blown<br />
With foam of fretful tides, with wail and moan<br />
Of waves, that toss wild hands, that clasp and beat<br />
Wild, desolate hands above the lonely sands,<br />
Printed no more with pressure of their feet:<br />
That chase no more the light feet flying swift<br />
     <span class="level2">Up golden sands, nor lift</span><br />
Foam fingers white unto their garment hem,<br />
     <span class="level2">And flowing hair of them.</span></p>

<p class="level1">"For these are dead: the fair, great queens are dead!<br />
The long hair's gold a dust the wind bloweth<br />
     <span class="level2">Wherever it may list;</span><br />
     <span class="level2">The curvÃ«d lips, that kissed</span><br />
Heroes and kings of men, a dust that breath,<br />
Nor speech, nor laughter, ever quickeneth;<br />
     <span class="level2">And all the glory sped</span><br />
From the large, marvelous eyes, the light whereof<br />
Wrought wonder in their hearts,&mdash;desire, and love!<br />
     <span class="level2">And wrought not any good:</span><br />
But strife, and curses of the gods, and flood,<br />
     <span class="level2">And fire and battle-death!</span><br />
     <span class="level2">Am I less fair, less fair,</span><br />
     <span class="level2">Because that my hands bear</span><br />
Neither a sword, nor any flaming brand,<br />
To blacken and make desolate my land,<br />
But on my brows are leaves of olive boughs,<br />
     <span class="level2">And in mine arms a dove!</span></p>

<p class="level1">"Sea-born and goddess, blossom of the foam,<br />
Pale Aphrodite, shadowy as a mist<br />
     <span class="level2">Not any sun hath kissed!</span><br />
     <span class="level2">Tawny of limb I roam,</span><br />
The dusks of forests dark within my hair;<br />
     <span class="level2">The far Yosemite,</span><br />
For garment and for covering of me,<br />
     <span class="level2">Wove the white foam and mist,</span><br />
The amber and the rose and amethyst<br />
Of her wild fountains, shaken loose in air.<br />
And I am of the hills and of the sea:<br />
Strong with the strength of my great hills, and calm<br />
With calm of the fair sea, whose billowy gold<br />
Girdles the land whose queen and love I am!<br />
     <span class="level2">Lo! am I less than thou,</span><br />
That with a sound of lyres, and harp-playing,<br />
     <span class="level2">Not any voice doth sing</span><br />
The beauty of mine eyelids and my brow?<br />
Nor hymn in all my fair and gracious ways,<br />
     <span class="level2">And lengths of golden days,</span><br />
The measure and the music of my praise?</p>

<p class="level1"><span class="level2">"Ah, what indeed is this</span><br />
Old land beyond the seas, that ye should miss<br />
For her the grace and majesty of mine?<br />
     <span class="level2">Are not the fruit and vine</span><br />
Fair on my hills, and in my vales the rose?<br />
     <span class="level2">The palm-tree and the pine</span><br />
Strike hands together under the same skies<br />
     <span class="level2">In every wind that blows.</span><br />
     <span class="level2">What clearer heavens can shine</span><br />
Above the land whereon the shadow lies<br />
Of her dead glory, and her slaughtered kings,<br />
     <span class="level2">And lost, evanished gods?</span><br />
     <span class="level2">Upon my fresh green sods</span><br />
No king has walked to curse and desolate:<br />
But in the valleys Freedom sits and sings,<br />
     <span class="level2">And on the heights above;</span><br />
Upon her brows the leaves of olive boughs,<br />
     <span class="level2">And in her arms a dove;</span><br />
And the great hills are pure, undesecrate,<br />
     <span class="level2">White with their snows untrod,</span><br />
And mighty with the presence of their God!</p>

<p class="level1"><span class="level2">"Hearken, how many years</span><br />
I sat alone, I sat alone and heard<br />
     <span class="level2">Only the silence stirred</span><br />
By wind and leaf, by clash of grassy spears,<br />
And singing bird that called to singing bird.<br />
     <span class="level2">Heard but the savage tongue</span><br />
Of my brown savage children, that among<br />
The hills and valleys chased the buck and doe,<br />
     <span class="level2">And round the wigwam fires</span><br />
Chanted wild songs of their wild savage sires,<br />
And danced their wild, weird dances to and fro,<br />
And wrought their beaded robes of buffalo.<br />
     <span class="level2">Day following upon day,</span><br />
Saw but the panther crouched upon the limb,<br />
     <span class="level2">Smooth serpents, swift and slim,</span><br />
Slip through the reeds and grasses, and the bear<br />
     <span class="level2">Crush through his tangled lair</span><br />
Of chaparral, upon the startled prey!</p>

<p class="level1"><span class="level2">"Listen, how I have seen</span><br />
Flash of strange fires in gorge and black ravine;<br />
Heard the sharp clang of steel, that came to drain<br />
     <span class="level2">The mountain's golden vein&mdash;</span><br />
And laughed and sang, and sang and laughed again,<br />
Because that 'now,' I said, 'I shall be known!<br />
     <span class="level2">I shall not sit alone;</span><br />
But reach my hands unto my sister lands!<br />
     <span class="level2">And they?  Will they not turn</span><br />
Old, wondering dim eyes to me, and yearn&mdash;<br />
     <span class="level2">Aye, they will yearn, in sooth,</span><br />
To my glad beauty, and my glad fresh youth!'</p>

<p class="level1"><span class="level2">"What matters though the morn</span><br />
Redden upon my singing fields of corn!<br />
What matters though the wind's unresting feet<br />
     <span class="level2">Ripple the gold of wheat,</span><br />
     <span class="level2">And my vales run with wine,</span><br />
     <span class="level2">And on these hills of mine</span><br />
The orchard boughs droop heavy with ripe fruit?<br />
     <span class="level2">When with nor sound of lute</span><br />
Nor lyre, doth any singer chant and sing<br />
     <span class="level2">Me, in my life's fair spring:</span><br />
The matin song of me in my young day?<br />
But all my lays and legends fade away<br />
From lake and mountain to the farther hem<br />
Of sea, and there be none to gather them.</p>

<p class="level1"><span class="level2">"Lo! I have waited long!</span><br />
How longer yet must my strung harp be dumb,<br />
     <span class="level2">Ere its great master come?</span><br />
Till the fair singer comes to wake the strong,<br />
Rapt chords of it unto the new, glad song!<br />
     <span class="level2">Him a diviner speech</span><br />
     <span class="level2">My song-birds wait to teach:</span><br />
     <span class="level2">The secrets of the field</span><br />
     <span class="level2">My blossoms will not yield</span><br />
     <span class="level2">To other hands than his;</span><br />
     <span class="level2">And, lingering for this,</span><br />
My laurels lend the glory of their boughs<br />
     <span class="level2">To crown no narrower brows.</span><br />
For on his lips must wisdom sit with youth,<br />
And in his eyes, and on the lids thereof,<br />
     <span class="level2">The light of a great love&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="level2">And on his forehead, truth!" . . .</span></p>

<p class="level1">Was it the wind, or the soft sigh of leaves,<br />
Or sound of singing waters?  Lo, I looked,<br />
And saw the silvery ripples of the brook,<br />
The fruit upon the hills, the waving trees,<br />
And mellow fields of harvest: saw the Gate<br />
Burn in the sunset; the thin thread of mist<br />
Creep white across the Saucelito hills;<br />
Till the day darkened down the ocean rim,<br />
The sunset purple slipped from Tamalpais,<br />
And bay and sky were bright with sudden stars.</p>
